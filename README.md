**Overview**

This JavaScript-based project, developed as part of my assessment (ID200485159, 2022a), implements a dynamic event scheduling interface. The core functionality revolves around sorting events by date and time, displaying them in a user-friendly manner, and allowing users to add events to a personal calendar stored in the browser's localStorage.

**Features**
-**Event Sorting**: Utilizes custom sorting functions to organize events first by date and then by time, ensuring that users see events in chronological order.
-**Dynamic Display**: Generates a dynamic HTML structure to display each event with its details (date, time, title, and description). Events happening on the current day are highlighted with a "Today" label for easy identification.
-**Local Storage Integration**: Offers users the ability to add events to their calendar with a simple button click. Events are stored in the browser's localStorage, making them persistent across sessions.

**Implementation Details**
-**Date and Time Sorting**: The program uses JavaScript's Date object to compare event dates. For time sorting, it pre-processes strings to ensure a uniform format before comparison.
-**Moment.js**: Utilizes Moment.js to manage and format dates, enhancing the program's capability to deal with date-related functionalities.
-**Local Storage Management**: Employs a straightforward approach to adding, storing, and retrieving events from localStorage, allowing for a simple yet effective way to manage user-added events.
-**Dynamic HTML Content**: Through DOM manipulation, the program dynamically constructs and appends HTML content based on sorted event data, providing a real-time update to the user interface.

**Usage**
The script is designed to be integrated into an HTML page where it will automatically sort any provided event data by date and time, display the events in a structured format, and manage user interactions for adding events to their personal calendar.

**Future Enhancements**
-Implement a more robust error handling system for date and time processing.
-Expand the local storage functionality to include event modification and deletion.
-Enhance the user interface for a more interactive and engaging user experience.

**Conclusion**
This project showcases a practical implementation of JavaScript, Moment.js, and browser localStorage to create a functional and user-friendly event scheduling interface. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as data sorting, DOM manipulation, and persistent storage management.
